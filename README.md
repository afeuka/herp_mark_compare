# herp_mark_compare
Code for Shiny application to compare handling time among different amphibian marking methods

There are two versions of this Shiny app: one that recreates manuscript-quality figures of handling time (Herp_Mark_Compare_app_gg.R) and one that produces interactive figures for the webpage version of the app (Herp_Mark_Compare_app.R).

Both files contain the user interface and server functions. 

The folder www contains images used in the app.
